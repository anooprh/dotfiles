# Emacs Config

This is a summary of my emacs config. I've been using emacs since several years now but I am not using it regularly because I forget the customizations , plugins and shortcuts I've added over time. I'm trying to list down them here for my future reference.

### Speedbar

Speedbar allows files in the directory to be viewed similar to the view in Sublime Text
